The Therenect is a virtual Theremin for the Kinect controller. It defines two virtual antenna points, which allow controlling the pitch and volume of a simple oscillator. The distance to these points can be adjusted by freely moving the hand in three dimensions or by reshaping the hand, which allows gestures that should be quite similar to playing an actual Theremin.

The application provides the following configuration options:

Oscillator: Theremin, Sinewave, Sawtooth, Squarewave
Tonality: continuos mode or  Chromatic, Ionian and Pentatonic scales
MIDI: optionally send MIDI note on/off events to the selected device & channel
Kinect: adjust the Sensor camera angle

Acknowledgments: This application has been created by Martin Kaltenbrunner at the Interface Culture Lab. It is based on OpenFrameworks and its ofxKinect example project, which is making use of libfreenect by the OpenKinect project. Many thanks to all the developers involved in the process, without their work this application wouldn't have been that easy to implement.

In order to compile this application you will need a working installation of OpenFrameworks and the ofxKinect extension. The provided application has been compiled as a Universal binary for Mac OS 10.5 or later.
